## Select Optimism Data Abstractions
**[Dune Spellbook](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models)**: *Tables can be used in [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards)*
- [`contracts_optimism.contract_mapping`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models/contracts/optimism): Near exhaustive mappings of contracts to project names on Optimism - uses decoded contracts in Dune (`optimism.contracts`) and known deployer addresses to map contracts.
- [`op_token_distributions_optimism.transfer_mapping`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models/op/token_distributions/optimism): Mappings of token distributions from the OP Foundation & by Grant/Growth Experiment recipients. You can use this table to count h0w much OP has been deployed, by who, and to where. *Note: These are "best guess" mappings* (contribute address mappings in the [Dune Spellbook repo](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models/op/token_distributions/optimism)).
- [`dex.trades`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models/dex): Aggregation of swaps across many decentralized exchanges
- [`nft.trades`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models/nft): Aggregation of swaps across many NFT marketplaces. Also see [`nft.wash_trades`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/blob/main/models/nft/optimism/nft_optimism_wash_trades.sql) by hildobby for filtering out likely wash trades.
- [`perpetual.trades`](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models/perpetual): Aggregation of swaps across many perpetuals exchanges (by rplust)

**[Flipside Crypto - Optimism Models > Gold-Level Tables](https://github.com/FlipsideCrypto/optimism-models/tree/main/models/gold)**: *Tables can be used in [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/)*
- [`optimism.core.ez_dex_swaps`](https://github.com/FlipsideCrypto/optimism-models/tree/main/models/gold/dex): Aggregation of swaps across many decentralized exchanges
- [`optimism.core.ez_nft_sales`](https://github.com/FlipsideCrypto/optimism-models/blob/main/models/gold/core__ez_nft_sales.sql): Aggregation of swaps across many NFT marketplaces

### Configs
For scripts which use APIs from providers with API keys, add the lines like below in a .env file (Replace with your API key - remember to add to gitignore):
```
DUNE_API_KEY = 'Your API Key'
FLIPSIDE_SHROOMDK_KEY = 'Your API Key'
```

### Installation
```
python -m pip install pipenv
pipenv install
```
See `Pipfile` for all the requirements.

### Common Requirements
Common packages used for python scripts include
- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)
- [aiohttp-retry](https://github.com/inyutin/aiohttp_retry)
- [dune-client](https://github.com/cowprotocol/dune-client)
- [subgrounds](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/subgrounds)
- [web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py)
- [ethereum-etl](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/ethereum-etl)

In this repository, we use `pre-commit` to ensure consistency of formatting. To install for Mac, run
```
brew install pre-commit
```
Once installed, in the command line of the repository, run
```
pre-commit install
```
This will install `pre-commit` to the Git hook, so that `pre-commit` will run and fix files covered in its config before committing.
